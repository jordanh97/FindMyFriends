# FindMyFriends

Find My Friends is a location based mobile application that enables users to find people at events or anywhere else.

Theme parks, Festivals, Concerts… While these places and events are usually incredible experiences often frequented and enjoyed by people in large groups, there is a simple problem that almost all attendees face. Concert entropy. Concert entropy dictates that at a concert or similar event, a large group of friends whilst usually arriving together, will lose their unity and become fractured as they split off in different directions until they are all equidistant from each other. Once this occurs the night becomes a drawn out and tiresome endeavour as friends desperately try to find each other, usually in the dark, amid a sea of thousands of people and deafening music. This concept is not only applicable to Concerts, Theme parks and Festivals but also a host of other events.

The application uses Google Location Services, The Internet and a Device’s Internal Gyroscope to accurately locate and display all your friends in one easy place. The application displays all your friends on a map in real time as well as with the help of the gyroscope, displaying the direction and distance of each friend. Friends will be able to opt in and out of sharing their location at any time as well as choosing who to share it with.
The application has the potential to change events forever, making them much more enjoyable to experience as friends and family are always easy to find.
